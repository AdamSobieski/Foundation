# Foundation 2024

This project intends to enable the development of educational technologies, e.g., [adaptive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_learning) instructional systems and [intelligent tutoring systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system), utilizing C++ and Python.

In addition to item-based educational scenarios, e.g., scenarios involving mathematics exercises, this project intends to enable new project-based educational scenarios involving IDEs, image-editing, 3D graphics, and CAD/CAE software.

  > AI models are historically better at closed tasks like solving a math problem or logical tasks like playing a game. In terms of life-wide and lifelong opportunities, we value learning how to succeed at open-ended and creative tasks that require extended engagement from the learner, and these are often not purely mathematical or logical. We want students to learn to invent and create innovative approaches. We want AI models that enable progress on open, creative tasks.

## Research Topics

This project will explore:

* uses of [large language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) (LLMs), [large multimodal models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model#Multimodality) (LMMs), and [multiagent systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiagent_system) (e.g., [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen)) to advance the design and development of educational-technology architectures.
* providing dynamic, contextual subsets of software applications' functionalities to AI systems.
  * providing tools for the development of parallel state machines for representing context.
* embedding [Python interpreters](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/) to enable the design and development of AI systems which provide task automation and content creation via automatically-generated source code (see also: [Copilot in Excel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGI6VLr8L5w)).
  * providing a permissions system.
  * providing undo and redo capabilities.
* providing multimodal feedback to AI systems (e.g., images, videos, or 3D models) as and after they execute source-code incrementally.
  * bidirectionally sharing multimedia data between software applications and interoperating AI systems.
* enhancing AI systems' question-answering and assistance-providing capabilities.
  * modeling educational items, exercises, activities, projects, and tasks.
  * modeling natural-language, machine-utilizable [design specifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_specification).
* modeling complex contexts which include multiple discussions, or threads, between users and AI systems.
* modeling educational event-streaming beyond [XES](https://xes-standard.org/), [OCEL](https://www.ocel-standard.org/), [Activity Streams](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/), [xAPI](https://xapi.com/), and [Caliper](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/caliper).
  * uses of event-stream data in providing context to AI systems. 
  * providing the capability for attaching multimedia data (e.g., text, images, video, and 3D models) to event streams.
* developing a client-side background process, or [service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_service), to encapsulate the details of configurably authenticating to, connecting to, and streaming data to remote cloud-based systems, e.g., [learning record stores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_Record_Store), operated by learners' schools. This background process will provide (e.g., COM+) components to other educational software such as Web browsers, digital textbooks, IDEs, image-editing, 3D graphics, and CAD/CAE software.

## Build Requirements

This project utilizes [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). To build this project, you will also need [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed and to configure the relevant projects in the solution to reference your installation's include and libraries directories.
