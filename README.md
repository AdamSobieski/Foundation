# Foundation 2024

This project intends to enable the development of educational technologies, e.g., [adaptive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_learning) instructional systems and [intelligent tutoring systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system), utilizing C++ and Python.

This project will explore uses of [large language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) (LLMs), large multimodal models (LMMs), and multiagent systems (e.g., [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen)) for designing and developing intelligent tutoring system architectures.

In addition to item-based intelligent-tutoring scenarios, e.g., scenarios involving mathematics exercises, this project intends to enable new project-based educational scenarios involving IDEs, image-editing, and CAD/CAE software.

Towards enabling these educational scenarios, this project will include a client-side background process, a [service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_service), which will encapsulate the details of streaming educational data streams to remote cloud systems operated by learners' schools. The described background process will provide (COM+) components for educational software applications such as Web browsers, digital textbooks, IDEs, image-editing, and CAD/CAE software.

## Selected Research Topics

This project will explore:
1. [embedding Python interpreters](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/) to convenience developing modern features such as application task automation via (AI-generated) Python source code (see also: [Copilot in Excel video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGI6VLr8L5w)).
2. techniques for providing contextual, stateful, and otherwise dynamic sets of available functions to LLMs and related multiagent systems.
3. multimodal interoperability with LMMs and multiagent systems as pertinent to the enhancement of image-editing and CAD/CAE software applications with AI.
4. models for educational event streaming beyond [xAPI](https://xapi.com/) and [Caliper v1.2](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/caliper). Ideas, in these regards, include providing the capability to send attached multimedia data, e.g., text, images, video, and 3D models.
5. models for educational items, exercises, activities, projects, and tasks. Educational tasks can, for example, contain subtasks which can be performed either in sequence or in parallel, e.g., working on parts which are to be combined into resultant assemblies using CAD/CAE software.

## Requirements

This project utilizes the Visual Studio 2022 IDE. To build, you will also need Python (>= 3.11) installed and to configure the relevant projects in the solution to reference your installation's include and libraries directories.
