# Foundation 2024

This project intends to enable the development of educational technologies, e.g., adaptive instructional systems and intelligent tutoring systems, utilizing C/C++ and Python.

This project will explore uses of large language models (LLMs), large multimodal models (LMMs), and multiagent systems approaches.

In addition to item-based intelligent-tutoring scenarios, e.g., the selection and presentation of interactive mathematics exercises, this project intends to enable project-based scenarios, e.g., by enabling interoperation with IDEs, photo-editing software, and CAD/CAE software.

Towards enabling these scenarios, this project will include a client-side service which will encapsulate the details of streaming educational data, e.g., event streams, to learners' schools. This service will provide components, e.g., COM+ components, to client-side software applications.

# Requirements

This project utilizes the Visual Studio 2022 IDE. To build, you will also need Python (>= 3.11) installed and to configure relevant projects in the solution to reference your installation's include and libraries directories.
