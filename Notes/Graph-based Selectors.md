## Introduction

An approach is described here for selecting nodes and edges in graphs for purposes of styling.

Let us consider an alternating node and edge pseudo-class-like syntax. For examples:
```
:node(...):edge(...) { property: value; }
```
or
```
:edge(...):node(...) { property: value; }
```

The contents in the parentheses, above, are to be drawn from a subset of the CSS selector syntax.

The following example intends to clarify:
```
:node([attr="value"]):edge(*):node(.has-selection) { color: blue; }
```

It appears that this syntax matches entire paths of nodes and edges and not single nodes or edges to apply styling to.

A solution, in these regards, is to utilize a single question-mark in the selector.

```
:?node([attr="value"]):edge(*):node(.has-selection) { color:blue; }
:node([attr="value"]):?edge(*):node(.has-selection) { color:blue; }
:node([attr="value"]):edge(*):?node(.has-selection) { color:blue; }
```

All three selectors match the same set of paths, and the question-mark symbol, limited to one per path, indicates which thing, which node or edge, to select for styling.

## Logical Operations

Logical operators, `:not()`, `:and()`, and `:or()`, can be utilized.

```
:node([attr="value"]):edge(*):or(:node(.txt-sel):?edge(.rt-clk), :node(.img-sel):?edge(.rt-clk)):node(.context-menu)
{
  color: blue;
}
```

## Repetition

`:repeat(min, max, pattern)` could be a shorthand notation for describing repetition.

```
:node([attr="value"]):repeat(0, 9, :edge(.key-press):node(*)):edge(.key-press):?node(*)
{
  color: blue;
}
```
